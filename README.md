## Implemented Solutions

Here's a summary of the implemented solutions for each question:

* **Bounding Box Counting:**
    * Implemented a function to solve the bounding box counting problem. This function takes a list of bounding box coordinates, image dimensions, and grid dimensions as input and returns a matrix representing the count of bounding boxes in each grid cell.
* **Sentiment Analysis:**
    * Implemented sentiment analysis using two different approaches:
        * TF-IDF + SVM: A baseline model using TF-IDF for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
        * BERT-base Fine-tuned Model: A transformer-based model (BERT-base) fine-tuned for sentiment classification.
* **Zero-Shot Classification:**
    * Performed zero-shot classification using LLMs.
    * Experimented with multiple text inputs and prompt variations.
    * Saved the LLM generated responses to a CSV file for analysis.
 
*  **Entity Extractor:**
Extract structured information such as People, Dates, Locations, Organizations, and Events from unstructured text using multiple AI models spaCy, OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face BERT via cli.
