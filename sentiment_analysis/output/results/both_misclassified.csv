this show was an amazing  fresh   innovative idea in the  s when it first aired  the first  or  years were brilliant  but things dropped off after that  by   the show was not really funny anymore  and it s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today it s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen  the writing is painfully bad  the performances are almost as bad   if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts  this show probably wouldn t still be on the air  i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed  how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity  i felt i must give  stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success  as it is now  the show is just awful  i can t believe it s still on the air ,negative,positive,positive
